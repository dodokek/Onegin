'Tis strange.
(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
(For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
A Gentleman, courtier.
A Norwegian Captain.
A Priest.
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
ACT I. Scene I.
Against the which a moiety competent
And I am sick at heart.
And carriage of the article design'd,
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
And let us once again assail your ears,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And prologue to the omen coming on,
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
And will not let belief take hold of him
As harbingers preceding still the fates
As it doth well appear unto our state,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
Ber. 'Tis here!
Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
Ber. He.
Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
Ber. I have seen nothing.
Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  
Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
Ber. It would be spoke to.
Ber. Last night of all,
Ber. Long live the King!
Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
Ber. Say-
Ber. See, it stalks away!
Ber. Sit down awhile,
Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
Ber. Well, good night.
Ber. Who's there.?
Bernardo, officer.
Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
But to recover of us, by strong hand
But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
Claudius, King of Denmark.
Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
Cornelius, courtier.
Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;  
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Dramatis Personae
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.
English Ambassadors.
Enter Ghost again.
Enter Ghost.
Enter Horatio and Marcellus.  
Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
Exit Ghost.
Exit Ghost.
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
For food and diet, to some enterprise
For it is as the air, invulnerable,
Fortinbras, Prince of Norway.  
Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
Fran. Bernardo?
Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
Fran. Give you good night.
Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
Francisco, a soldier
Getrude, Queen of Denmark, mother to Hamlet.
Ghost of Hamlet's Father.
Give you good night.                                   Exit.
Guildenstern, courtier.
Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.
Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Hor. 'Tis here!
Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
Hor. A piece of him.
Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  
Hor. As thou art to thyself.
Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
Hor. Friends to this ground.
Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
Hor. That can I.
Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Hor. Well, sit we down,
Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
Horatio, friend to Hamlet.
I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
If there be any good thing to be done,
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Is not this something more than fantasy?
Is the main motive of our preparations,
Laertes, son to Polonius.
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Lords, ladies, Officers, Soldiers, Sailors, Messengers, Attendants.
Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
Mar. 'Tis gone!
Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Mar. Is it not like the King?
Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Mar. It is offended.
Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
Mar. Question it, Horatio.
Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
Marcellus, Officer.
Marcellus, officer.
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
O, speak!
Of mine own eyes.  
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,  
Ophelia, daughter to Polonius.
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Osric, courtier.
Players.
Polonius, Lord Chamberlain.
Reynaldo, servant to Polonius.
Rosencrantz, courtier.
SCENE.- Elsinore.
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
Speak to me.
Speak to me.  
Spreads his arms.
Such was the very armour he had on
Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
That are so fortified against our story,
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
That was and is the question of these wars.
That, if again this apparition come,
The bell then beating one-
The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
The cock crows.
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
The source of this our watch, and the chief head
Therefore I have entreated him along,  
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
This present object made probation.
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
To his confine; and of the truth herein
To offer it the show of violence;
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Together with that fair and warlike form
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
Two Clowns, gravediggers.
Unto our climature and countrymen.
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Voltemand, courtier.
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
What think you on't?
What we two nights have seen.
What, is Horatio there ?
When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.    
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
Who hath reliev'd you?
Who is't that can inform me?
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Why this same strict and most observant watch
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
With us to watch the minutes of this night,
Without the sensible and true avouch
his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].
