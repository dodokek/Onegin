Success come
A lonely Capibara
   Walked along the street;
His girlfriend's name was Sara.
   And he loved her indeed!
I like to to eat concreet



Like doritos, let's eat some

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same.

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
